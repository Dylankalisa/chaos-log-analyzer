chaos-log-analyzer is a log analysis and failure-mode inspection tool designed to extract systemic patterns from noisy, high-volume logs, including those produced by AI-assisted systems.

It is built to answer:

“When things break, why did they break — and is it systemic?”

Key Capabilities

Structured parsing of heterogeneous logs

Failure clustering and anomaly detection

Correlation of errors across services and time

Root-cause signal extraction from chaotic execution environments

AI-Relevant Focus

This tool is particularly useful for:

Diagnosing failures caused by AI-generated code

Identifying regressions after prompt or model changes

Understanding retry storms, invalid outputs, or malformed responses

Use Cases

Post-mortem analysis

AI-generated code regression tracking

Observability enhancement for complex systems

Debugging non-deterministic failures
